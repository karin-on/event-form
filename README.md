# Hotree project

##### by Karina Nowicka



Hi! 

Thank you for inviting me to your recruitment process. It's been fun working on this task!



#### Running the project

To run the project please go to the repo's directory and:

1. create an **images** directory so that the project could be compiled successfully (sorry, my Webpack config :))

2. in the command line please run the commands:

   `npm i`

   `npm start`

The project will be running in your browser at http://localhost:8080/.



#### Remarks

1. I don't validate the `email` address. It's automatically loaded from the **employees.js** file instead.
2. Due to the time limitation the styling isn't complete.
